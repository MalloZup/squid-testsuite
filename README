We test the squid proxy, with following machines: 1 server (apache), 1 proxy, 1 client.

We do two tests:
 1: http proxy
 2: https prox

Additionaly, we check that the log on proxy side contains no error and no fatal warning.

We forbid any direct communicatio√†n between client and server with iptables.

## TODO:
- test https without --no-check-certificate option
- test authentication on proxy
- test page filtering with squidguard
  http://dsi.ut-capitole.fr/blacklists/index_en.php
- other functionality
- run or integrate testsuite upstream from squid project here (?)
